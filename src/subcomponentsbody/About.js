        <h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
       <p>
  Hi, I'm <strong>Manya Yadav</strong>, a <strong>2025 Computer Science Engineering graduate</strong> from <strong>JMIT, Radaur</strong>, and a passionate, performance-driven <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>. I specialize in building robust and scalable web applications using the <strong>MERN stack</strong> (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), backed by a solid foundation in <strong>Data Structures, OOP</strong>, and <strong>DBMS</strong>.
  <br/><br/>

  <strong>Over the past year, I’ve:</strong><br/><br/>

  ✅ Built and deployed multiple live projects, including a secure <em>Notes Sharing App</em>, a real-time <em>Chat App</em>, and a high-performing <em>Blog Platform</em>, serving <strong>thousands of users</strong>.
  <br/><br/>

  ⚙️ Gained hands-on experience in <em>Agile development</em>, <em>JWT/Bcrypt authentication</em>, and <em>Redux-based state management</em>, boosting performance by <strong>up to 40%</strong> and enhancing user experience.
  <br/><br/>

  ☁️ Collaborated on <em>cloud-ready</em>, <em>microservice-based systems</em>, reducing product delivery timelines by <strong>20%</strong>.
  <br/><br/>

  💡 With <strong>500+ coding problems solved</strong> across <em>LeetCode</em>, <em>HackerRank</em>, and <em>GeeksforGeeks</em>, and participation in national-level hackathons like <strong>SIH</strong>, <strong>Kavach</strong>, and <strong>Flipkart Grid</strong>, I bring a rare mix of <strong>technical expertise</strong>, <strong>problem-solving grit</strong>, and <strong>team collaboration</strong>.
  <br/><br/>

  🚀 I'm now ready to join a <strong>dynamic, growth-focused team</strong> where I can contribute to impactful digital products, learn from the best, and continue growing as a developer.
